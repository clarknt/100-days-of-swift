# Project 24

https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/80

Includes solutions to the [challenges](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/24/5/wrap-up).

This is a playground project.

## Challenges

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/24/5/wrap-up):
>1. Create a String extension that adds a withPrefix() method. If the string already contains the prefix it should return itself; if it doesn’t contain the prefix, it should return itself with the prefix added. For example: "pet".withPrefix("car") should return “carpet”.
>2. Create a String extension that adds an isNumeric property that returns true if the string holds any sort of number. Tip: creating a Double from a String is a failable initializer.
>3. Create a String extension that adds a lines property that returns an array of all the lines in a string. So, “this\nis\na\ntest” should return an array with four elements.
