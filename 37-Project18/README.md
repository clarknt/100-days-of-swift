# Project 18

https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/64

Not an actual project as it does not have a GUI and doesn't do much. Published for the sake of completion.

For challenges 1 and 2 see [Project 18 - Challenges 1-2](../38-Project18-Challenges1-2)

## Challenges

1. Temporarily try adding an exception breakpoint to project 1, then changing the call to instantiateViewController() so that it uses the storyboard identifier “Bad” – this will fail, but your exception breakpoint should catch it.
2. In project 1, add a call to assert() in the viewDidLoad() method of DetailViewController.swift, checking that selectedImage always has a value.
3. Go back to project 5, and try adding a conditional breakpoint to the start of the submit() method that pauses only if the user submits a word with six or more letters.
