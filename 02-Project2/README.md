## Challenges

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/2/6/wrap-up):
>1. Try showing the player’s score in the navigation bar, alongside the flag to guess.
>2. Keep track of how many questions have been asked, and show one final alert controller after they have answered 10. This should show their final score.
>3. When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message – something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France,” for example.
