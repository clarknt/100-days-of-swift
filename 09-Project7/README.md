## Challenges

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/7/6/wrap-up):
>1. Add a Credits button to the top-right corner using UIBarButtonItem. When this is tapped, show an alert telling users the data comes from the We The People API of the Whitehouse.
>2. Let users filter the petitions they see. This involves creating a second array of filtered items that contains only petitions matching a string the user entered. Use a UIAlertController with a text field to let them enter that string. This is a tough one, so I’ve included some hints below if you get stuck.
>3. Experiment with the HTML – this isn’t a HTML or CSS tutorial, but you can find lots of resources online to give you enough knowledge to tinker with the layout a little.
