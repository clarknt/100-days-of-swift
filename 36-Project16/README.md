## Challenges

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/16/4/wrap-up):
>1. Try typecasting the return value from dequeueReusableAnnotationView() so that it's an MKPinAnnotationView. Once that’s done, change the pinTintColor property to your favorite UIColor.
>2. Add a UIAlertController that lets users specify how they want to view the map. There's a mapType property that draws the maps in different ways. For example, .satellite gives a satellite view of the terrain.
>3. Modify the callout button so that pressing it shows a new view controller with a web view, taking users to the Wikipedia entry for that city.
