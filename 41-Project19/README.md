## Challenges

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/19/8/wrap-up):
>1. Add a bar button item that lets users select from a handful of prewritten example scripts, shown using a UIAlertController – at the very least your list should include the example we used in this project.
>2. You're already receiving the URL of the site the user is on, so use UserDefaults to save the user's JavaScript for each site. You should convert the URL to a URL object in order to use its host property.
>3. For something bigger, let users name their scripts, then select one to load using a UITableView.
